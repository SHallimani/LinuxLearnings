How does the atomic and non-atomic variable differs technical point of view

An atomic function performs a read-modify-write atomic operation on one 32-bit or 64-bit variables

When we declare any variable as atomic, the operation that we are going to perform are executed in atomic mode (without preempting the current
operations on the atomic variable) internally it uses the LDREX and STREX instructions and perform add/sub/mux instruction on the atomic
variables

The operation is atomic in the sense that it is guaranteed to be performed without interference from other threads.
So in other words, no other thread can access this address until the operation is complete
